## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Testing (Recommended)

1. **Start Redis**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7
   ```

2. **Start Server**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/pwang/Developer/stock-analyzer-backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   python src/run_server.py
   ```

3. **Test API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Check scheduler status
   curl http://localhost:8001/scheduler/status
   
   # Create a test job
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/scheduler/jobs \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Test Job",
       "stock_ids": ["AAPL", "MSFT"],
       "schedule_time": "17:00"
     }'
   
   # List jobs
   curl http://localhost:8001/scheduler/jobs
   ```

4. **Verify Redis Storage**
   ```bash
   redis-cli KEYS "scheduler:*"
   ```

### Phase 2: Code Review

1. Review implementation against design
2. Check for any deviations
3. Verify error handling
4. Test edge cases
5. Performance testing

### Phase 3: Merge (After Approval)

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update CHANGELOG (if exists)
3. Create pull request
4. Code review
5. Merge to dev branch

## Risk Assessment

### Impact: ✅ LOW RISK

- Only 2 lines added to existing code
- No existing functionality modified
- Isolated module
- Can be disabled by removing router

### Compatibility: ✅ COMPATIBLE

- Uses existing components as-is
- No API changes to existing endpoints
- No database schema changes
- Redis keys use separate namespace

### Rollback: ✅ EASY

If issues occur:
1. Remove 2 lines from server.py
2. Delete scheduler module
3. Restart server
4. All existing functionality restored

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage

- Scheduler thread: ~1MB
- Per job: ~10KB
- Registry: Depends on number of jobs

### CPU Usage

- Idle: ~0% (sleeping)
- Checking: ~0.1% (every 60 seconds)
- Executing job: Depends on number of stocks

### Network Usage

- Job execution: Same as manual fetch
- Registry operations: Minimal Redis I/O
