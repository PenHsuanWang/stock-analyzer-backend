# Scheduler Module - Executive Summary

## What This Design Delivers

A **cron-like job scheduler** that allows users to set up automated daily stock data fetching jobs without modifying any existing code.

---

## Key Features

✅ **Daily Scheduled Jobs** - Run data fetching at specific times (e.g., 5 PM daily)  
✅ **Multiple Stock Support** - Fetch data for multiple stocks in one job  
✅ **Full Job Management** - Create, read, update, delete, start, stop jobs via API  
✅ **Background Execution** - Non-blocking thread-based scheduler  
✅ **Fault Tolerant** - Individual stock failures don't stop the job  
✅ **Zero Code Changes** - Existing functionality completely unaffected  
✅ **RESTful API** - 8 clean endpoints for job management  
✅ **Redis Storage** - Persistent job configuration and data storage

## Architecture at a Glance

```
User → FastAPI Router → SchedulerServingApp → JobScheduler → JobExecutor
                                                    ↓
                                            YFinanceFetcher (existing)
                                                    ↓
                                            DataIOButler (existing)
                                                    ↓
                                               Redis Storage
```

**Impact on Existing Code:** Only 2 lines added to `server.py`

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/scheduler/jobs` | Create a new scheduled job |
| GET | `/scheduler/jobs` | List all jobs |
| GET | `/scheduler/jobs/{id}` | Get job details |
| PUT | `/scheduler/jobs/{id}` | Update a job |
| DELETE | `/scheduler/jobs/{id}` | Delete a job |
| POST | `/scheduler/jobs/{id}/start` | Activate a job |
| POST | `/scheduler/jobs/{id}/stop` | Deactivate a job |
| GET | `/scheduler/status` | Get scheduler status |

---

## Usage Example

### Create a Daily Job

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/scheduler/jobs" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Daily Tech Stocks",
    "stock_ids": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "TSLA"],
    "schedule_time": "17:00"
  }'
```

**Result:** Every day at 5 PM, the system will automatically fetch and store data for all 5 stocks.

---

## Files to Create (8 files)

### Core Module (5 files)
1. `src/core/scheduler/__init__.py`
2. `src/core/scheduler/job_definition.py` - Job data model
3. `src/core/scheduler/job_registry.py` - Job storage manager
4. `src/core/scheduler/job_executor.py` - Job execution logic
5. `src/core/scheduler/job_scheduler.py` - Main scheduler engine

### Webapp Module (2 files)
6. `src/webapp/serving_app/scheduler_serving_app.py` - API service
7. `src/webapp/router/scheduler_serving_app_router.py` - FastAPI router

### Modification (1 file)
8. `src/server.py` - Add 2 lines to include router

---

## Design Principles Followed

✅ **Open-Close Principle** - Extended without modifying existing code  
✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each class has one clear purpose  
✅ **Dependency Inversion** - Depends on abstractions, not implementations  
✅ **No Side Effects** - Existing functionality completely unaffected  
✅ **Composition over Inheritance** - Wraps existing components  

---

## Thread Architecture

```
Main Thread (FastAPI Server)
    │
    └─> Scheduler Thread (Background Daemon)
            │
            ├─> Job Execution Thread 1
            ├─> Job Execution Thread 2
            └─> Job Execution Thread N
```

- Scheduler checks every 60 seconds for due jobs
- Each job executes in its own thread
- Non-blocking, won't affect API response times

---

## Data Storage in Redis

### Job Configuration
```
Key: scheduler:job:{job_id}
Value: {job configuration JSON}
```

### Job Index
```
Key: scheduler:job_index
Value: [list of job IDs]
```

### Fetched Stock Data (uses existing format)
```
Key: scheduled_stock_data:AAPL:2025-09-21:2025-10-21
Value: [stock data JSON]
```

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Tasks |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | 2 days | Core module implementation |
| Phase 2 | 1 day | Webapp integration |
| Phase 3 | 2 days | Testing and validation |
| **Total** | **5 days** | Complete implementation |

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Job validation
- Registry CRUD operations
- Executor logic
- Scheduler thread management

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end job creation to execution
- Redis data verification
- Error handling

### API Tests
- All 8 endpoints
- Request validation
- Response formats

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Background Thread?
- Non-blocking for API requests
- Simple implementation
- Sufficient for daily scheduling
- Easy to debug

### Why Not Celery/APScheduler?
- Avoid heavy dependencies
- Match existing simple architecture
- Full control over scheduling logic
- Easier maintenance

### Why Redis for Job Storage?
- Consistent with existing storage pattern
- Simple key-value operations
- No new infrastructure required
- Easy to inspect and debug

---

## Safety Guarantees

✅ **No Code Modifications** - Existing files unchanged (except 2 lines)  
✅ **No Breaking Changes** - All existing APIs work exactly as before  
✅ **Isolated Execution** - Scheduler failures won't affect main app  
✅ **Graceful Degradation** - Job failures don't crash scheduler  
✅ **Thread Safe** - Proper locking for concurrent operations  
✅ **Clean Shutdown** - Graceful thread termination on server stop  

---

## Extension Points (Future)

The design allows easy extension for:
- Weekly/monthly schedules
- Multiple times per day
- Job chaining (fetch → analyze)
- Email notifications
- Webhook callbacks
- Job history tracking
- Performance metrics
- Web UI dashboard

## Questions Answered

**Q: Will this break existing functionality?**  
A: No. Only 2 lines added to server.py, all existing code untouched.

**Q: Can I disable the scheduler?**  
A: Yes. Just don't include the router in server.py.

**Q: How do I test without waiting for 5 PM?**  
A: Set `check_interval=10` and `schedule_time` to current time + 1 minute.

**Q: What if Redis goes down?**  
A: Jobs will fail but scheduler continues. Jobs resume when Redis recovers.

**Q: Can jobs run concurrently?**  
A: Yes. Each job runs in its own thread.

**Q: What happens if server restarts?**  
A: Jobs are persisted in Redis. Scheduler recalculates next_run on startup.
