# Project Title: Stock Analyzer Backend

This project leverages the power of Python's FastAPI framework to provide users with a robust service for stock analysis. Our system is designed to fetch data from external sources like Yahoo Finance and store it in a local Redis instance for rapid access.

The Python backend server of this project is engineered to serve frontend requests seamlessly. It shoulders the responsibilities of workflow management, data read/write operations, and the orchestration of various analysis processes. However, it's crucial to note that the number-crunching and numerical computations aren't done within this backend project. Instead, these stateless numerical operations are executed by a distinct package named stockana. Only logic and operations pertaining to computational states are present within this project. Our project is modularized into three main packages: core, utils, and webapp.

### Core Package

**Purpose**:  
The `core` package primarily focuses on the internal logic and services required to maintain and manage our data storage, manipulation, and retrieval operations.

**Components & Responsibilities**:  

- **Service Manager**: Takes care of initiating, stopping, or restarting various services within our system, such as Redis connections or background data-fetching tasks.
  
- **Data Processor**: This module handles all internal data manipulations, such as filtering, sorting, or transforming the raw data obtained from external sources.
  
- **Cache Handler**: Interfaces with the Redis instance to set, get, or delete cached data items.

---

### Utils Package

**Purpose**:  
`utils` package contains helper modules that serve various utility functions required throughout the project.

**Components & Responsibilities**:  

- **data_io**: As the main bridge to external data sources, `data_io` handles:
  - Data extraction from Yahoo Finance.
  - Data serialization and deserialization for efficient storage and retrieval.
  - Error-handling for external API issues or rate limiting.

### Webapp Package

**Purpose**:  
The `webapp` package is where all the pieces come together in a user-friendly interface. It provides users with tools to fetch, visualize, and analyze financial data without diving into the internal mechanics.

**Components & Responsibilities**:  

- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints that the frontend interacts with to request or post data.
  
- **Frontend Interface**: A sleek user interface that lets users choose stocks, view charts, and access stored data.
  
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: This module coordinates the sequence of tasks from fetching data from Yahoo Finance, processing it in `core`, storing it in Redis, and then serving it to the frontend.

## Getting Started

To begin working with the Financial Data Integration System, ensure you have the prerequisites installed (e.g., Python, Redis) and follow the setup guidelines provided in each package's individual README.md file.

### Developer Notes:

Always ensure that you're familiar with the purpose and responsibilities of each package before diving in. Modularity has been emphasized to ensure that each section of the codebase can be understood, maintained, and tested independently.

Remember, the above is a basic example and might need modifications based on the exact specifics of your project, such as system dependencies, contributors, or additional modules. Always tailor documentation to fit your project's unique requirements and characteristics.
